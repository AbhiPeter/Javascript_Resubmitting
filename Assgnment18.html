    <!--
    slice uses the start and end index
    both can be optional if you dont give any index it will show whole string
    end index does not take the higher index value is not included.
    you can use the negative value as well in start and end index
    negative indexing strats with -1 from end of the string
    you cannot use the higher index as start because it does not goes backward (it do not swap value)
